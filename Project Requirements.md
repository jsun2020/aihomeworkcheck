## **1. Product Overview**

### **1.1. Product Vision**

To create an intelligent, secure, and user-friendly web application that empowers parents to efficiently check their children's written homework. The application will leverage advanced AI to automatically identify spelling/character errors and provide insightful analytics, transforming a daily chore into a constructive learning tool while maintaining the highest standards of child data protection.

### **1.2. Target Audience**

**Primary Users:** Parents of primary school children (ages 6-12) who are responsible for reviewing daily homework assignments. They are typically tech-savvy but time-constrained, seeking efficient solutions for managing their children's education.

**Secondary Users:** 
- Teachers seeking to understand common student errors
- Tutors working with multiple students
- Educational institutions (future B2B opportunity)

### **1.3. Problem Statement**

Manually checking a child's homework for typos and miswritten characters is time-consuming, repetitive, and prone to error. Parents lack an easy way to track recurring mistakes and quantify their child's writing volume over time, making it difficult to identify persistent learning gaps and measure progress effectively.

### **1.4. Core Solution**

A secure, privacy-focused web application where parents can upload photos of their children's homework. The backend service, powered by multi-modal AI with confidence scoring, will analyze the image to:

1. Transcribe the text with high accuracy
2. Identify and highlight incorrect characters/words with confidence levels
3. Calculate total word/character count
4. Store results securely for historical analysis
5. Generate actionable insights about learning patterns
6. Provide exportable reports for teacher conferences
